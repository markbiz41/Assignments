<h1>Should you Relocate your Tech Startup to Silicon Valley?</h1>


<p>Many stories of tech startups being created in Silicon Valley (otherwise known as San Jose, California) have sprung up from this region.  It is here in this region where success is rewarded with stock options and recognition of peers but even founders of a failing startup can get a badge of honor for just trying to launch a startup.  Failure is seen here as a stepping stone to success.  Why do thousands of people, including immigrants, flock to Silicon Valley every year?</p>

<p>One of the reasons people come to Silicon Valley is due to the tech talent that is available in the area.  Another reason might be that Silicon Valley has the highest percentage of venture capital firms in the area.  If your startup is looking for capital, this area has an abundance of resources such as business incubators and technology accelerators to assist you.  But does all this mean to pack up your bags and move to Silicon Valley?</p>

<p>Although there is alot of tech talent in Silicon Valley, what programmers charge there is very expensive compared to other areas of the United States.  In addition, the housing market in San Jose, California is a hot market with startup founders cashing out their million dollar stock options and then buying up real estate in the area which is driving up housing prices as well as rental prices.  Also, you can now raise equity capital online through equity crowdfunding sites, like Angel.co and Gust.com, which make getting money for your company much easier anywhere in the United States.  My advice to any entrepreneur starting a tech startup is to check out other areas around the United States like Austin, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; Raleigh, North Carolina; and many more.  These other areas have technology talent that is cheaper than Silicon Valley and more affordable housing options.  So take the time to investigate where you want to locate your startup.</p>
