<p>Today is a great time to raise capital for your tech startup even if you are not in Silicon Valley.  Why now you might ask?  Well, venture capitalists and angel investors have been known to pour money into technology sector than any other business sector.  Software accounts for up to 90% of venture capital investments portfolio.  In addition to this, certain types of websites have come about called equity crowdfunding platforms.  Many people most likely have heard of Kickstarter.com or Indiegogo.com, which raise money for companies with projects in a donation/reward fashion but this is not equity crowdfunding.  Equity Crowdfunding are websites where startups or small businesses can raise equity capital from accredited investors online in exchange for a slice of the company's common stock.  The equity crowdfunding sites that have become well known are Angel.co, Gust.com, SeedInvest.com, FlashFunders.com and many more.

<p>I know that you are getting inpatient with me and are asking "where is the get rich part of starting a tech app?"  The getting rich part will all come down to what your exit strategy is for a startup.  Basically, getting rich will be based upon how much of the equity you still have in the company, the tech apps poplularity and usefullness, and your exit straegy.  If you decide to accept capital from venture capitalists or angel investors, then you have three exit strategies such as initial public offering (IPO), your startup gets acquired, or remain a private company but exchange shares on a private stock exchange like SecondMarket.com or SharesPost.com.</p>

<p>When a company decides to do an initial public offering, it is now offering it's companies common stock to the public by way of a stock exchange such as NASDAQ or NYSE.  Once this company starts trading on the exchange, the valuation goes up to the millions to billions of dollars.  Company founders get rich when they trade in their shares for money.  If a startup decides to get acquired by another company, the startup normally is acquired for a premium price.  Most of the time these startups get acquired for a price in the millions to billions of dollars. The final exit strategy is to remain a private company but exchange company shares on a private stock exchange.  This is a farelly new kind of exit strategy that just came about since 2008.  Startup companies, their founders, and investors can exchange their shares on the private stock exchange, such as SecondMarket.com or SharesPost.com, for money.  Many have made millions of dollars going this route as well.  Plus company founders can keep their companies private and away from menacing hedge fund investors who plan to take the company in a different direction than the one set out by the founder.</p>
