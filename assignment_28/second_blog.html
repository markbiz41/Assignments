    <h1>Learning HTML and hearing from a Guest Speaker</h1>

    <p>Well now I am learning HTML and CSS.  I did the General Assembly online Dash course which helped me familarize myself with this type of code.  Since it has been awhile, I don't recall every bit of functionalilty that HTML and CSS has.  Luckily, I have the HTML Elements reference page to check out to see what type of code I can use for my blog.  My biggest concern is linking the HTML pages together.  In addition, a guest speaker came in to talk about his 17 year career as a Java software developer who had worked for Valpak, Nielsen Media Group and other software projects.  The important tips that I got out of his speech were to have a blog, keep a portfolio of your software projects you have completed, and stay active on your industry's forums.</p>
