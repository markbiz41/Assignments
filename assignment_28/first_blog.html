    <h1>My Coding at the IronYard</h1>

    <p>Since coming to the IronYard software academy, I have been learning alot about computer programming.  The lectures in the morning are very informational.  The problem that I am now encountering is being able to apply what I have learned during the lectures and then putting in the proper code for some type of program to run.  Easier said than done.  Even though I did the Codeacademy.com online Ruby course, still I am having difficulty putting in the proper code that the system will accept.  As of right now, I am still optimistic that all of this will "click" and I will be able to code better as time goes by.</p>


    <summary>This is my first blog at the IronYard.  Stay tuned for another blog post coming soon.</summary>
